Components:
- Parser / Printer
- Level: Static empty level description
	- with static analysis info
- Cell: describes one floor in Level - static data
	- allows iterating over its neighbors
	- immutable
- Builder: constructs Cells/Level from abstract description

- [Normalized] Key: describes positions of boxes in level and position of agent
	- agent is represented as cloud of reachable positions (not a single one)
- ?? Need a way to store dynamic analysis data

Principles:
- DONE no static data
- [in progress] minimize memory usage
- DONE benchmark to evaluate different variants on large problem set

- DONE lazy normalization of Keys
- DONE compare keys by [total, -pushes]
